			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and housing supply</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			Single-family zoning plays a major role in shaping housing supply, affordability, and patterns of
			inequality, and it is frequently criticized as an exclusionary policy that limits access to housing for
			low-income and minority communities (<a href="https://wapo.st/48huLqt" target="_blank">Washington Post:
				Houses are too expensive. Apartments are
				too small. Is this a fix?</a>). Reporting on the Massachusetts housing crisis highlights statewide
			affordability pressures (<a
				href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/special-projects/spotlight-boston-housing/beyond-the-gilded-gate/"
				target="_blank"> Boston Globe Spotlight Report
				into the Massachusetts housing crisis</a>) but articles on like <a
				href="https://cityobservatory.org/the-illegal-city-of-somerville/" target="_blank">City Observatory: The
				Illegal City of Somerville</a> focus on how restrictive zoning operates in specific municipalities.
			these accounts often emphasize either the state as a whole or individual case studies, leaving open the
			question of how single-family zoning varies across municipalities and whether its impacts differ by local
			context. Therefore, I wabt ti examine how single-family zoning is distributed across Massachusetts, whether
			it follows
			geographic patterns (e.g., urban versus suburban or rural areas), and whether zoning share is associated
			with demographic composition or population size. In doing so, I also want to investigate which municipalities exhibit the
			largest differences between single-family and other residential zoning areas and whether income or
			demographic patterns systematically vary with zoning share. Thus, my questions are:
			<ol>
				<li>How is single-family zoning distributed across Massachusett's municipalities?</li>
				<li>Is there a relationship between single-family zoning share and demographic composition (age,
					race/ethnicity, gender)?</li>
				<li>Is there a relationship between municipality population size and the share of single-family zoning?
				</li>
				<li>Which municipalities end up with the biggest differences between single-family zoned and other
					housing zoned areas?
				</li>
				<li>Do demographic or income patterns systematically differ by single-family zoning share?
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

					The share of single-family zoning for each municipality. Around half the municipalities inside
					Massachusetts, like Boston, seem to have implemented no single-family zoning while some cities like
					Dover seem to only support single family housing. So what are the geographic characteristics of each
					of these municipalities? One intuition might be that suburban and rural municipalities prioritize
					single-family housing, lets see if that checks out.

					Municipalities on a map of Massachusetts showing the share of single-family zoning in each
					municipality. Darker blue represents 100% single-family zoning while light blue represents 0%.
					Notice
					that the each the east coast generally has lower single-family zoning than western Massachusetts.
					It also seems that more rural municipalities like Dover and Bolton have more single-family zoning
					but
					conversly that Southborough, which is just beside Dover, has no single-family zoning.
					Something therefore to wonder is: why do municipalities beside each other not have similar policies?
					Are there population-level differences?

					Municipality population sampled by MAPC Zoning Atlas in 2010. Darker shades of blue represent single
					higher single-family zoning. There doesn't seem to be any patterns between population and single
					family housing, however, note the scale and inaccuracy of the population for each municipality.
					Although Boston is a much larger city than Salem (with a real-world population of over 600,000
					compared to Salem's ~41,000 in 2010), Boston has only 1,369 people listed in this dataset, all of
					whom live in "other housing zoning" (non-single-family). This represents only a tiny fraction of
					Boston's actual population, suggesting that the vast majority of Boston's residential land was not
					included in the specific "housing zones" processed for this dataset.
					<br />
					Common explanations might be that the population is scaled incorrectly; however after double
					checking the metadata and applying various linear transforms to the data, there still seemed to be
					inconsistencies. Another explanation might be that Salem is just an outlier, however this also does
					not seem to be the case as there are many population inconsistencies across most of the cities (as
					checked via google search). Both these can be explained by observing the municipality ranking shown
					in the x-axis, which is ordered by highest to lowest population.
					<br />
					Also note that three cities (Chelsea, Somerville, Everett) also have no recorded population meaning
					that certain kinds of demographic data in this dataset is unavailable from these areas (age, gender,
					race/ethnicity).
					<br />
					Since the population is off by such a large margin, I also wonder if there is agreement between
					other population size signals used in this dataset.

					Signals of population count provided in the dataset. The first two figures compare population count
					measured from 2010 census data (pop column) to the the sum between family households (fhh column)
					and non-family households (nfhh column), sampled in 2010, which quantify the number of families in
					each household (first figure) and total number of households (hh column) sampled from 2014 to 2018
					to find various household income levels (second figure). The third figure plots the two household
					counts against each other. Each dot represents a municipality.
					<br />
					Notice that neither of these other signals really correlate with each other (i.e. they were off from
					the y=x line), meaning that the number of households sampled in 2010 and 2014-18 if the even if a
					municipality had a larger population sample than another, it didn’t necessarily mean that it had
					proportionally more households. The last plot shows that the number of households measured across
					different years was quite different. This could be due to how sampling was performed or it could be
					due to the number of households increasing over the year as it is difficult to make sure there is
					consistency in sampling in this dataset.
					<br />
					Note 1: in terms of data processing, it mentions in the metadata that "there are two rows
					for some municipalities in this dataset which indicates only single-family zoning and other housing
					zoning" meaning both rows for the same municipality have the same population count but different
					counts for number of households (these are summed in the visualization above).
					<br />
					Note 2: A quality check was performed to make sure that different columns sum to the population or
					household counts above.

					Municipalities on a map of Massachusetts showing the share of single-family zoning in each
					municipality, overlaid with pie charts showing the proportion of gender (only measuring male or
					female), age (under 18, 18-64, over 64), and race/ethnicities. Darker blue represents 100%
					single-family zoning while light blue represents 0%. Municipalities color white have no recorded
					statistics.
					<br />
					We can note the overall characteristics of municipalities across Massachusetts. The majority are
					between 18-64 and white, and approximately split between male and female. We can notice that in the
					east coast the population is a bit older (more folks over 65) where single family zoning tends to be
					lower. It is also notable that Massachusetts also has a large Asian and Black minority mostly
					located in areas in low single-family zoned areas.
					<br />
					An interesting question to wonder is: what if you group municipalities close to each and with
					similar demographic distribution into a single municipality. Also, this map doesn’t capture the
					nuance between single-zoned housing areas vs housing areas zoned differently and instead aggregate
					these statistics across all zones. I would be curious to see how demographics shift across different
					zoning areas.
					<br />
					Note that even though the absolute population sample size was off, one of the main assumptions going
					forward in this analysis is that the collected sample roughly represents the distribution of
					different demographic characteristics for each municipality. However, I do acknowledge that this may
					not be the case. While there were time constraints for this assignment, a more thorough analysis
					would likely perform statistical tests which would evaluate error or bias in the sample (possibly
					via statistical contrasts or visualization of bootstrapped confidence intervals).

					This shows a connected dot plot which shows the majority demographics (from left to right: male, age
					18-24, and none-white hispanic) across municipalities with both single-family (red) and other zoning
					areas (blue), sorted by the share of single-family zoning in the municipality, starting with lowest
					percentage at the top).
					<br />
					Here, there are no clear trends between differences in single-family and other zoned areas. Note
					that the female population in Quincy and Medford is the most affected by single-family zoning, while
					interestingly, the male demographic is most affected in Weymouth. We also see that single-family
					housing zones disproportionately affect 18–64-year-olds the most in Weymouth and Wellesley.
					Additionally, we noted that racial minorities in Newton and Wellesley were the most affected, with
					the non-Hispanic White population increasing from 60% to almost 90%.

				<figcaption>
					This stacked bar chart shows the proportion of household income across multiple tiers (from under
					$10k to over $200k) sorted by the share/percentage of single-family zoned housing in each
					municipality. Again, there is no direct correlation between the percentage of single family zoning
					and municipality. We can see that Winthrop, Nshant, and Chelsea have small household incomes on
					average, while cities like Needham and Medfield have a lot of households at high income brackets.
					It's also interesting to note cities like Wellesley have almost no one from low income brackets.

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				Single-family zoning in Massachusetts is unevenly distributed across municipalities, with many eastern
				and
				coastal cities (for example, Boston)showing little to no single-family zoning, while more rural and
				western
				municipalities (for example, Dover and Bolton) have very high shares. However, neighboring towns can
				adopt very
				different zoning policies, meaning that geography alone does not determine zoning patterns. There does
				not appear to be a clear relationship between municipality population size and single-family zoning
				share,
				although inconsistencies and sampling limitations in the dataset make precise comparisons difficult. At
				the
				municipal level, demographic composition (age, race/ethnicity, and gender) does not show a strong
				correlation with the share of single-family zoning, though some municipalities with lower single-family
				zoning tend to be
				more racially diverse and slightly older along the eastern coast. Within municipalities, some notable
				differences emerge: places like Newton and Wellesley show substantial racial shifts between
				single-family
				and other zoning areas, with single-family zones having much higher shares of non-Hispanic White
				residents.
				Finally, income patterns do not systematically track with zoning share across the state, but some
				wealthier
				municipalities such as Needham, Medfield, and Wellesley tend to have both higher incomes and substantial
				single-family zoning, while lower-income cities like Chelsea and Winthrop have little single-family
				zoning
				overall. Specfically, I found the case of Wellesley to be particularly interesting as has such high
				disparitiy in demographics between single-family and other zoning areas but also a high income level.
