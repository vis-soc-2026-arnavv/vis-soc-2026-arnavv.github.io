				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I notice that the band has the smallest width in the hot summer months, meaning there might be lower
					COVID cases during that season. This to me indicates that there might be something about summer
					months which maybe reduced the spread of COVID. </li>
				<li>I notice that during all COVID years (ignoring 2020 since there were no cases recorded), the red
					band is the widest around December/January, meaning that COVID cases peak around the winter holiday
					season.
				</li>
				<li>I notice that the red band is the widest in the beginning of 2022, by a large margin. This might
					mean that there are going to be a record number of cases in the 2022 winter season.
				</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				The visualization encodes the weeks of each year in polar coordinates, with the years 2020–2022
				represented as a spiral timeline. The spiral line shows the progression of each year, and the area
				inside the red band sitting on the line represents the number of new COVID cases, averaged across each
				week. This encoding makes seasonal patterns easy to see, and the trend between 2020 to 2022 appears
				salient. The radial layout also makes it relatively clear where to begin reading; however it is unclear
				why the spiral starts at an arbitrary location — it could begin at center to better draw attention and
				adhere to conventions for spirals. The spiral expanding outwards also helps showcase a sense of the
				impending future. However, visualizing this data as a spiral in polar coordinates can also be confusing
				in many ways. While it highlights broad seasonal patterns, it makes comparisons of COVID cases across
				different months (e.g. March and July) or entire years (2021 vs 2020) more difficult because differences
				in area are harder to perceptually differentiate when they are not right above one another. A standard
				line chart or small multiples by year might make month-to-month comparisons clearer while still
				preserving seasonal patterns. In addition, when reading yearly trends the layout can be slightly
				misleading: because 2020 is inside the 2021 spiral, the 2021 line is longer, which may cause the viewer
				to think the designer is exaggerating the timeline and the number of cases in 2021 (due to area on the
				outside being larger than the inside for the same numerical values).
				<br />
				Area bands around a line are associated with the convention of showing uncertainty of some value so
				using these bands to encode the 7-day average also threw me off a little bit. I would try to pick a
				different mark which does not look similar to an uncertainty band and could be useful (maybe a line
				centered around 0). On this subject, showing uncertainty or variation in the data is not necessary but
				if the average value was not encoded in another mark besides area, it could be useful to show the
				variation within each week across all 7 days. The spiral line also does not appear to encode additional
				information besides acting as a timeline and therefore seems somewhat redundant (as the timeline already
				implicitly communicated with the spiral of the area mark.
				<br />
				I take the target audience to be the average U.S. citizen reading the article, and I think the
				visualization generally communicates broad trends in COVID cases and emphasizes seasonal effects by
				“stacking” or rather spiraling years on top of months. Here, I think adding seasonal markers directly
				along the spiral would make temporal orientation clearer and reduce the cognitive effort required to
				interpret the timeline and allow people to better compare seasonal trends. Overall, while the
				unconventional data encoding to the spiral and the polar coordinates of the chart draw attention, they
				may add confusion to the interpretation. The takeaway was also a bit unclear since I’m not sure exactly
				how I should think about increases in covid cases — is it due to seasonal factors only or is there
				something more? Why should we expect even greater and greater increases seasons over season? While most
				elements are reasonably labeled, I think legend is poorly designed since it doesn't showcase what the
				maximum value of new COVID-19 cases would look like and the wording inside makes it seem like daily
				COVID-19 cases are being shown rather than the 7-week average. I also wished the annotation would point
				to specific events to provide meaningful interpretation of why such trends might be occurring.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="covid_cases/fig1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					A faceted line chart showing the average number of new confirmed cases per week for each year from
					2020 to the start of 2022. Each facet represents a different year, with the final facet showing
					early 2022 and a trend of increasing cases.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I wanted to try to keep monthly/seasonal comparisons accessible for new cases while also allowing
					the viewer to visually perceive yearly trends across each year. This would also allow a comparison
					of year trends. I also wanted to use a more common convention so it would make parsing the chart a
					bit easier.
				</li>
				<li>
					By encoding the number of new cases in a line, I hoped this chart would encourage people to consider
					the area beneath the line and compare it across seasons. I wanted people to take away that while the
					area during the summer months is low and only marginally different, the winter months are where the
					trends really matter, showing clear year-over-year differences. To highlight this message, I also
					added an annotation emphasizing the differences at the end of the year.
				</li>
				<li>
					I think this chart did a great job roughly showing yearly trends and showing broad differences in
					seasonal trends. However, I think the exact week-over-week difference between years is not prominent
					and so it's hard to compare when looking back and forth between two different charts. In the next
					chart, I want to remove the facets and combined information in one chart to highlight larger
					differences year-over-year relative to the minor differences.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="covid_cases/fig2.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					A layered line chart in which each line shows the average number of new confirmed cases per week for
					each year. The shaded areas highlight year-over-year differences (solid indicates fewer cases than
					the previous year, while shaded regions indicate more cases than the previous year), with the
					largest differences occurring in winter.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This time, I wanted to make the differences between years more prominent and to highlight the large
					differences between the winter seasons of 2021 and 2022 more explicitly. I also wanted to make
					comparisons between years easier and more precise.
				</li>
				<li>
					By creating layered charts and shading regions where cases were higher than in the previous year, I
					hoped to address the aforementioned issues and make comparisons of weekly differences between years
					easier.
				</li>
				<li>
					Here, I think that following the lines between different years may have been somewhat confusing, so
					adding color to the lines may be useful. While I felt the emphasis on differences was clear, simply
					showing the large gaps in cases through the colored areas between lines was too conventional and did
					not effectively convey how significant the differences were, and the impact of each case. In the
					next sketch, I want to emphasize the importance of every new case across all weeks.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="covid_cases/fig3.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					A bubble chart showing the average number of cases faceted by year, with each week being represented
					by a circle. The size of each bubble emphasizes the number of cases, with the largest bubble showing
					over 100,000 cases in January 2022.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For this sketch, I wanted to clearly show the impact of each case through a slightly more
					unconventional visualization to evoke emotion. While I think showing trends across the months and
					precise differences between weeks is important, I also wanted to emphasize the gravity of having
					significantly more cases.</li>

				<li>By drawing a bubble for each week and encoding its size as the number of cases, I hoped to
					communicate that 2022 not only had higher COVID-19 case counts during the winter compared to other
					years, but also that they were much higher than in previous months. I also hoped that the quantity
					of circles (one circle per week) and their sizes would evoke a stronger sense of impact while still
					somewhat following conventions. While I wanted to make things very unconventional like the original
					chart which had some emotional impact — I was reminded that the original chart may be considered too
					unconventional in a way that hinders engagement.</li>

				<li>While I think the size and quantity of the circles convey more emotion, I still think faceting by
					year makes comparisons between months more difficult to follow. Although the annotations help draw
					attention to differences in circle sizes and seasons, a layered approach might be more effective for
					comparing sizes, perhaps while encoding year using color and opacity. In the final design, I want to
					explore encoding information with color and opacity, such that yearly trends can be overlaid while
					also drawing emphasis on seasonal differences.</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>

			<figure id="d3-viz">
				<img src="covid_cases/final_chart.png" alt="" />
			</figure>
			<p>
				Here, I was looking to emphasize not only the average number of new COVID-19 cases across different
				years like the original visualization, and show seasonal and future trends, but also to show the death
				toll relative to each new case. I did this to both emotionally ground the consequences of each new
				COVID-19 case but also showcase the impact of preventive and medical measures year-over-year. I used the
				circle mark to encode the 7-day average for new COVID-19 cases, representing one circle for each week
				because it helps visually perceive linear trends over and between weeks and years. It also provides
				slightly less clutter than drawing out a line. I used color to encode different years so a comparison
				across seasons and years could be made, however one problem which this created was that it was hard to
				see overlapping circles. To solve this, I lowered the opacity of all circles such that overlaps were
				obvious. All colors were chosen to be different kinds of grey hues because I wanted to emphasize the
				gravity and consequences of each case through darker colors associated with death and sickness. I
				encoded the number of deaths as the size of the circles. I did this to showcase how height (number of
				new cases) correlated with number deaths, across each year and to really drive home the emotional impact
				of each case. Specifically to show how health and hospital infrastructure and accessibility was lagging
				behind in 2021 as compared to 2022, which might have led to more deaths per case. I also highlight the
				background different shades of red, showcasing different seasons, with the opacity being relative to the
				average number of deaths in that season. This made sure to emphasize the trend of the drastic cases and
				deaths in the winter time. While information in this visualization showcases death as a consequence of
				getting diagnosed with COVID-19, it perhaps frames this as the only significant consequence. There are
				many other tragic outcomes which are not covered, like the number of hospitalizations, permanent health
				issues, financial damage, which might drive a significant burden on individuals and families which are
				not shown inside this visualization.
				<br />
				On a side note: while aggregating the data for the number of new cases in 2022, I noticed that there
				were a few outliers. There was no data between week 38 to 51 but there was data for week 52. I also
				found a day with negative values. Due to these reasons, during the data processing stage, I omitted
				those weeks from my visualization.
				<br />
				I think that the final design addresses most of the critiques I surfaced in Step 2. I was able to remove
				the confusing area bands with circle marks that more clearly represent the 7-day average and reduce
				visual clutter. Removing the spiral and polar coordinates also simplifies the timeline and makes the
				chart easier to interpret, while encoding deaths as circle size adds meaningful context about the
				severity of COVID cases across years, which was missing. I also tried annotations to emphasize certain
				trends and points of importance. The design process helped me try out a different set of marks and
				strategies to emphasize seasonal and yearly differences. I think I was able to incorporate the lessons
				from all of the prior designs, specifically about showcasing linear trends from designs 1 and 2,
				showcasing differences by shading (does with opacity in the final sketch) from design 2, and showcasing
				impact and consequences via circle mark and size from design 3. Something I was not able to incorporate
				was communicating the notion of variation in the data as it would add to the visual clutter and the
				circle marks do not come with strong conventions for showcasing variation or uncertainty. Overall,
				this process made me realize that not all marks and channels come with the same baggage. While I was
				able to encode size within the circle mark and make my visualization “easy” to read due to cultural conventions,
				it would not have been true if I chose another shape like line.
